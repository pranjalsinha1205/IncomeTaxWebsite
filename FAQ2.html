        <p>In order to bring growth and business into the states, the governing bodies, be it the ancient kings and kingdoms or the urban governance systems and institutions,  had to and must find a way in which the aspirational and monumental progressions could be met. Hence the Taxation system arises.</p>
        <p>With the contribution of the citizens, their lifestyle and living in myriad ways are pulled toward betterment by the governing bodies. Taxation has been part and parcel of Sovereign states and is rather timeworn.</p>
        <p>If we talk about taxation in India we must understand the structure of income tax, being the largest democracy in the world and the largest middle class market in the world India is a tax payer’s haven.</p>
        <br><h3>Types of Income Taxes in India</h3>

        <ol>
            <li>Central Government</li>
            <li>State Government</li>
            <li>Municipal Bodies</li>
        </ol>
