        <h1>Income Tax Slabs and Rates</h1>
        <p>Income Tax Slabs in India are announced by the finance minister every year. Currently, there are two different Income Tax regimes. Under the new regime, tax benefits cannot be availed. Under the old regime, taxpayers can avail of tax benefits.

            This year, the finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman has announced the Union Budget for 2022 on 1 February 2022. In the latest budget, no changes have been proposed for the existing income tax slabs and rates.
            
            Note: You can now file your taxes through the New income tax portal. The new portal comes with a plethora of features and is designed to ease the tax filing process.</p>

        <h2>What is Income Tax Slab?</h2>
        <p>Income Tax Slab defined as the Individual taxpayers will need to pay the income tax based on the slab system they fall under. Depending on the income of the individual, he/she may fall under a different tax slab. Therefore, individuals with a higher income will need to pay more tax. The slab system was introduced to maintain a fair tax system in the country. The slabs tend to change at every budget announcement.</p>
        <h3>Income Tax Slabs remain Unchanged</h3>
        <p>There was no change in income tax slabs for individuals as no announcement was made by Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman during the Union Budget 2022. Senior Citizens aged 75 years and above were however exempted from filing income tax if their only source of income was through a pension.</p>
